I use random,reversed,sorted 5000 and check for 'real' running time
I tried to determine the upper bound and the lower bound of each method

sort1 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
This method is the least efficent in terms of sorting,
Sorting time is the longest out of the three methods

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
Merge sort is known for the fastest sorting method.
Sorting time is the fastest


sort3 uses: Mubble sort

How do you know?:
This method is faster than selection sort but slower than merge sort
Sorting time shows the same.


sort 1:
random 5000:
real 0m0.054s - 0m0.084s

reversed5000:
real 0m0.062 - 0m0.0104s

sorted5000:
real 0m0.020s - 0m0.051

sort2:
random
real 0m0.021 - 0m0.050s

reverse
real 0m0.021s - 0m0.034s

sorted
real 0m0.021s - 0m0.032s


sort3:
random
real 0m0.039s - 0m0.089s

reversed
real 0m0.041s - 0m0.057s

sorted
real 0m0.038s - 0m053s

*These numbers are not exact, just the average of many run tests
